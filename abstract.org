Post-processing Cactus simulations with Python

kuibit is a Python library for quantitative post-processing and visualization of
Cactus simulations. In this tutorial, I will first introduce the package and
present some of its design choices. Then, I will walk through the first steps
for new users, including installation, setup, and running some provided
examples. Next, I will develop a script from scratch for a new analysis and
visualization. In doing this, I will discuss some of the most important aspects
of the library.
